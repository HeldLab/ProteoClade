*de novo* Searches
==================
*de novo* searches yield peptide sequences without a reference database. ProteoClade enables the ability to annotate *de novo* search results to understand which organisms are present in the sample and what proteins they are expressing.

File Format Requirements
------------------------
Files generated from *de novo* search engines, like PEAKS, are typically in long format rather than wide format – i.e., there is a single column for all samples. Candidate PSMs (multiple suggestions for one MS/MS scan) can be used as long as the file is sorted first by sample:scan, and second by score (in descending order). The required input format for these files is a .csv or .txt with the following columns (required: RED, optional: GREY):

The table must contain:

* Exactly one peptide column (options: Sequence, Peptide, pep_seq)
* Exactly one sample column (options: Sample, Scan). **Formatting for this column must be: Sample:Scan**.
* At most one score column (options: Score, ALC (%))
* At most one quantitation column (options: Area, Intensity)

Annotation
----------

These files can be annotated in the same way as peptide files for targeted searches, but instead using the function `annotate_denovo <pcannotate.html#annotate-denovo>`_. The parameters are the same with one change: a PSM matching method option is added.

In order to preserve memory, this function generates a “denovo_matched” file containing only organisms and genes from the PCDB file and then invokes the `annotate_peptides <pcannotate.html#annotate-peptides>`_ function on that file to add additional taxa, if specified in the *taxon_levels* parameter.

A typical output will include the peptide sequences, sample quantitation, spectral counts for that peptide, organisms, genes, and higher taxa if specified:
